## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or later
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- PEC mailbox credentials (for SDI delivery)

git clone https://github.com/gianlucamazza/openfatture.git
cd openfatture
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
```

Populate `.env` with company data, PEC credentials, and notification settings (see `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`), then initialise the database:

```bash
uv run python -c "from openfatture.storage.database.session import init_db; init_db()"
```

### Next Steps
- Follow the extended quickstart in `docs/QUICKSTART.md` or the slim walkthrough in `QUICKSTART.md`.
- Review the complete CLI catalogue in `docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md`.
- Explore `docs/PAYMENT_TRACKING.md` to master reconciliation and reminders.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PEC Connection Problems:**
```bash
# Test PEC credentials
uv run openfatture pec test

# Check SMTP settings in .env
uv run openfatture config show | grep PEC
```

**AI Model Issues:**
```bash
# Check AI configuration
uv run openfatture config show | grep AI

# Test AI connectivity
uv run openfatture ai describe "test" --format json
```

**Database Issues:**
```bash
# Reinitialize database (WARNING: destroys data)
uv run python -c "from openfatture.storage.database.session import init_db; init_db()"

# Check database path
uv run openfatture config show | grep database_url
```

**SDI Validation Errors:**
```bash
# Validate XML before sending
uv run openfatture fattura xml 123 --validate

# Check compliance
uv run openfatture ai check 123 --level advanced --verbose
```

**RAG Knowledge Base Issues:**
```bash
# Check RAG status
uv run openfatture ai rag status

# Reindex knowledge base
uv run openfatture ai rag index --force
```

**Event System Issues:**
```bash
# Check event persistence
uv run openfatture events stats

# View recent errors
uv run openfatture events list --type ErrorEvent --limit 10
```

### Getting Help

- **Logs**: Check `~/.openfatture/logs/` for detailed error information
- **Debug Mode**: Add `--verbose` to most commands for additional output
- **Configuration**: Run `openfatture config show` to verify settings
- **Tests**: Run `uv run python -m pytest tests/` to check system health
