3. **Italian Context**: Commands are designed for Italian invoicing context
4. **Manual Reload**: Users must run `/reload` after editing command files

---

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter issues during testing:

1. **Check Logs**: Look for errors in console output
2. **Verify Setup**: Ensure commands are in `~/.openfatture/commands/`
3. **Test Isolation**: Try command individually to isolate issue
4. **Document**: Note exact command, expected vs actual behavior
5. **Report**: Create GitHub issue with reproduction steps

---

## Success Metrics

After completing UAT, the feature should demonstrate:

- **Discovery**: Users can easily find and learn about custom commands
- **Execution**: Commands work reliably and produce expected results
- **Flexibility**: Users can create their own commands following examples
- **Performance**: System remains responsive under typical workloads
- **Reliability**: No crashes, data loss, or critical errors

---

## Next Steps After UAT

1. **Document Findings**: Record any issues or improvements needed
2. **Create Tickets**: File GitHub issues for any bugs found
3. **Gather Feedback**: Collect user feedback on UX and workflow
4. **Iterate**: Make improvements based on testing results
5. **Deploy**: Merge to main branch if all criteria are met
