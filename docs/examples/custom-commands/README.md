## Creating Your Own Custom Commands

### Command File Structure

Each command is defined in a YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
name: my-command              # Command name (use in chat as /my-command)
description: Command description for help
category: general             # invoicing, tax, clients, reporting, compliance, general
aliases: [alias1, alias2]     # Alternative names
author: Your Name             # Optional
version: "1.0"                # Optional

template: |
  Your command template here.
  Use Jinja2 syntax for variables:
  - {{ arg1 }} - First positional argument
  - {{ arg2 }} - Second positional argument
  - {{ args }} - All arguments as list
  - {{ argN | default('default value') }} - With default

examples:
  - "/my-command arg1 arg2"
  - "/alias1 \"quoted argument\""
```

### Template Variables

- `{{ arg1 }}`, `{{ arg2 }}`, ... - Positional arguments (indexed from 1)
- `{{ args }}` - List of all arguments
- `{{ argN | default('value') }}` - Argument with default value
- `{{ argN | upper }}` - Apply Jinja2 filters (upper, lower, title, etc.)

### Tips for Writing Effective Commands

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear structure and expected outputs
2. **Use Context**: Reference OpenFatture's domain (invoices, clients, VAT, SDI)
3. **Request Formatting**: Ask AI to format responses with tables, bullets, etc.
4. **Add Examples**: Include usage examples in the YAML
5. **Provide Defaults**: Use Jinja2 filters for optional parameters
6. **Test**: Use `/reload` to refresh commands after editing

### Example: Simple Custom Command

Create `~/.openfatture/commands/hello.yaml`:

```yaml
name: hello
description: Greet a person
category: general
aliases: [hi, ciao]

template: |
  Say hello to {{ arg1 | default('World') }} in a friendly way.
  Include an emoji and wish them a great day!

examples:
  - "/hello Alice"
  - "/hi"
```

Usage:
```
> /hello Bob
ðŸ”§ Custom command expanded:
Say hello to Bob in a friendly way...

ðŸ¤– AI:
Hello Bob! ðŸ‘‹ I hope you're having a wonderful day...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found
- Check file is in `~/.openfatture/commands/`
- Verify YAML syntax is correct
- Use `/reload` to refresh registry
- Check `/custom` to see loaded commands

### Template expansion error
- Verify Jinja2 syntax (use `{{ variable }}` not `{ variable }`)
- Check for matching quotes in template
- Test with simple template first

### Command works but AI response is poor
- Make template more specific
- Add example outputs in template
- Request specific formatting (tables, bullets, etc.)
- Use domain terminology (fattura, cliente, IVA, SDI)

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Logic

```yaml
template: |
  Analyze service: {{ arg1 }}
  {% if arg2 %}
  For client: {{ arg2 }}
  {% endif %}
  {% if arg3 %}
  Amount: {{ arg3 }}â‚¬
  {% else %}
  (Amount not specified)
  {% endif %}
```

### Loops

```yaml
template: |
  Generate invoices for:
  {% for client in args %}
  - {{ client }}
  {% endfor %}
```

### Filters

```yaml
template: |
  Client: {{ arg1 | upper }}
  Service: {{ arg2 | title }}
  Amount: {{ arg3 | default('0') }}â‚¬
```

## Integration with OpenFatture

Custom commands have full access to AI capabilities:
- âœ… Tool calling (search invoices, clients)
- âœ… RAG enrichment (knowledge base, invoice history)
- âœ… Structured outputs
- âœ… Session persistence
- âœ… Cost tracking

The AI agent processes custom command expansions just like regular user input,
so you can leverage all OpenFatture features within your commands.
